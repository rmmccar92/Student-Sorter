## Introduction

The Student Sorter App is a powerful tool designed to help educators efficiently organize and manage student data. Whether you're a teacher, administrator, or anyone else involved in education, this app streamlines the process of sorting and categorizing students into individual groups. I made this for my own productivity but feel free to take a look and use/alter it for your own purposes.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface:** The app offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for educators to navigate and utilize its features. I used a drag and drop library to make the experience easy and fun!
- **Group Creation and Management** Create edit and manage groups through the student page.
- **User Authentication:** Secure user accounts with authentication to ensure data privacy and integrity.
- **Responsive Design:** Access the app from any device with a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
